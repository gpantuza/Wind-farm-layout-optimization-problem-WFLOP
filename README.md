This project focuses on the wind farm layout optimization problem (WFLOP). WFLOP consists of determining the optimal position of the turbines in a wind farm so that electricity production is as high as possible. 
In other words, given a limited and fixed set I of possible locations to install precisely k
wind turbines, WFLOP consists of finding the best physical arrangement of the wind turbines in a wind
farm to obtain the maximum power produced by the turbines. 
A wind farm is a limited geographical space on the continent (onshore) or at sea (offshore) where turbines are installed.
A priori, wind energy harnesses the wind’s kinetic energy to move turbines and produce electricity, so the greater the number of turbines, the greater the energy produced.
